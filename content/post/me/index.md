Welcome!
This is the portfolio of Pablo Wynistorf.

I'm an **IT apprentice** at [Swisscom (Schweiz) AG](https://www.swisscom.ch) located in Bern, Switzerland. I am currently in my **third year of four** as a **Computer Scientist in Plattformengeneering**.

In my freetime I really like 

I have participated in the **[SwissSkills competition 2023](https://www.ict-berufsbildung.ch/ictskills2023)** in the **Cloud Computing** category and reached the **second place**. In cause of that, I got invited to a assessment, where the best two participants of each year SwissSkills 2021 and 2022 are competing versus each other, in order to find the matching competitor for the **[WorldSkills 2024 in Lyon](https://worldskills.org/what/competitions/worldskills-lyon-2024)**. I'm very proud and happy to be able to say, that I got selected by the SwissSkills Comitee. That concretely means that I will represent Switzerland in the **[WorldSkills 2024 in Lyon, France](https://worldskills.org/what/competitions/worldskills-lyon-2024)**. 

If I have aroused your interest, please feel free to take a look at my [Curriculum vitae](/p/cv/).
