## Project Overview

At the Openair Frauenfeld 2024, we were tasked with an ambitious mission: to create a state-of-the-art network infrastructure across the festival grounds, ensuring seamless connectivity for thousands of attendees. Collaborating closely with our partner company [Konzept5](https://konzept5.ch), we deployed an extensive array of networking equipment, including over 50 Cisco Switches and approximately 30 Access Points, all interconnected via a robust mix of fiber and copper cabling. This setup powered a variety of critical services, from public WiFi to backstage communications, ensuring the festival ran smoothly.

The festival layout was vast and complex, as shown below:
